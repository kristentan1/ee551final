# Welcome!
Welcome to my EE-551 Final Project, a BMI Calculator designed to not only tell users what teir BMI is, but also provide them with related information to make informed decisions about their own health. 

# How to Get Started
If you'd like to get started using my BMI Calculator, here's what to do. First, you'll want to 'git clone' this repo. Then, 'cd' into the directory, and install the necessary libraries by running 'pip install requests' and 'pip install beautifulsoup4.' And that's it! You're ready to get started. To run the application, ensuring first that you are still in the proper directory, just type 'python bmicalculator.py' to open up the GUI. Enjoy!
